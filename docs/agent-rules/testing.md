# Testing, QA, and UI Pull Requests

Detail moved out of `AGENTS.md`, which has a 10 KiB budget.

## Commands

```sh
make test                         # Full gate: Go race + all frontend suites
make test-fast                    # Go race + Vitest unit/browser (no Storybook/E2E/perf)
make test-unit                    # Vitest in Node
make test-browser                 # Vitest in headless Chromium
make test-e2e                     # Playwright: desktop + Pixel 7 Chromium
make test-browsers-install        # Chromium (+ Linux libraries; may require sudo)
```

- Target a frontend test with `pnpm --dir web exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts test/input.test.ts`.
- Target an E2E spec with `pnpm --dir web exec playwright test test/e2e/terminal.spec.ts`.
- Target a Go package with `go test -race ./internal/session`.

## What to cover

- Go tests use the standard `testing` package.
- Linux/macOS lifecycle tests cover child-process cleanup, waiting detection, and input cancellation. Subreaper reaping is Linux-only.
- macOS temp paths sit behind `/var -> /private/var`. Compare against canonical paths: packages' `TestMain` canonicalizes `TMPDIR`, and E2E uses `realpath`.
- Preserve behavioral coverage for authentication/Origin rejection, argv boundaries, replay continuity, exit ordering, cancellation, terminal input/rendering, and touch interactions.
- No numeric coverage threshold is configured.
- Chromium mobile emulation does not replace real-device iOS Safari/Android keyboard and native selection-menu checks.

## Test runtime

- Browser tests exercise real Svelte/Tailwind/xterm rendering without a backend.
- Local `make test` builds one production frontend and `.cache/webmux-e2e/webmux` once.
  - It also builds the fake ACP agent (`internal/acp/testdata/fakeagent`) as `.cache/webmux-e2e/agents/{omp,opencode,codex,codex-acp,claude,claude-agent-acp}`.
  - E2E/performance reuse them via `WEBMUX_E2E_BINARY`. Agents are found in `agents/` beside it.
  - `make test-fast` skips Storybook, E2E and performance.
- Workers share only the immutable executables. Each has an independent backend, HOME/config/workdirs, fake-agent session stores (the agents come first on each backend's `PATH`) and dynamic ports.
  - Up to two workers locally, two on Ubuntu CI and four on macOS CI. `WEBMUX_E2E_WORKERS` overrides.
  - Session, process and hybrid-record cleanup is automatic.
- Do not connect tests to an existing developer service.

## CI

- CI classifies changed paths in the `Classify changes` job (`.github/scripts/classify-changes.sh`).
  - Docs-only changes run the formatting, documentation, persistence and agent/web static guards without the test suites.
  - Go-only changes skip Vitest, Storybook and performance. Web-only changes skip both Go race jobs, the Windows cross-compile and the Windows installer smoke. E2E still runs for either.
  - Unknown paths, `.github/**`, `Makefile`, module/lockfile changes and installer tooling force a full run. Do not use `on.pull_request.paths`: the required `Test result` check must always report.
  - The job validates the base itself, forces a full run for any `.github/` change, and executes the base revision's classifier so a PR cannot weaken the rules that skip its own tests.
  - Every push to main forces the complete suite (classification is skipped), so a merged commit normally has a full result.
    GitHub keeps at most one pending run per concurrency group, so a rapid burst of merges can still cancel an intermediate pending run; the release falls back to `full: true` for such a commit.
  - `release.yml` first runs the `verify` job (`.github/scripts/require-main-test.sh`) for the tagged commit.
    - Reuse: the commit is on main and its `push` Test run passed with no skipped job. `Checks` is skipped.
    - Fallback: not on main, no run, a failed or partial run, or the run did not finish within the wait budget. `Checks` calls `test.yml` with `full: true` itself.
    - `sign` and `publish` need one of the two to have passed, so a tag never releases without the complete suite.
  - The release `Build` job only builds, checksums and verifies the real artifacts (including the deb/rpm install check); it does not rerun Go tests, which `Go race` already covers.
- CI builds the Linux and macOS E2E executables, fake agents and frontend output once in the `E2E runtime` job (`.github/scripts/package-e2e-runtime.mjs`).
  - Go race, macOS Go race and every E2E shard depend on that job and reuse its same-run artifact, including the locked Playwright runtime.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs parallel jobs:
  - Ubuntu: formatting/architecture guard/frontend build, Go race, Vitest, Storybook, single-worker 4x CPU performance, and four E2E shards (desktop and mobile projects).
  - E2E shards reuse the executable and Playwright packages; they skip pnpm/frontend dependencies and Go setup.
  - macOS: native Go race (excluding the static guards `archtest`/`docguard` and the Windows `tray`/`wsl`/`wslclient` packages) using the shared frontend output, and two desktop-project E2E shards on separate runners.
  - `Test result` aggregates every job, accepts intentionally `skipped` results, and cross-checks that every job the classifier selected actually succeeded.
- Every browser job installs Chromium through `.github/actions/playwright`, which caches the Linux apt packages because a slow Ubuntu mirror can otherwise consume a job's whole timeout.
- Go modules and the Go build/test cache use separate keys: modules follow `go.mod`/`go.sum`, while the build cache rolls over weekly (and on module changes) so `main` refreshes it without saving a full copy per Go commit.
- PR runs restore caches read-only and superseded PR runs are cancelled. Caches are saved from `main`.
- Failure diagnostics live in `web/playwright-report/`, `web/test-results/`, and `web/.vitest/attachments/` (uploaded per job). Open the E2E HTML report with `pnpm --dir web test:e2e:report`.

## UI pull request evidence

- PRs that change visible UI (layout, styling, components, or interaction states) MUST embed screenshots of the final implementation in the PR description.
  - Capture the running app or its real Storybook components. Mockups and test summaries do not replace screenshots.
- Show before/after views for changes to an existing interface.
  - Include the affected light/dark themes and desktop/mobile layouts when the change spans them.
  - Label the viewport and any sample data.
- Use GitHub attachments or committed image URLs that reviewers can open. Local filesystem paths and localhost URLs are not valid PR image links.
- Check that the images render in the published PR and refresh them when later changes alter the UI.
- Use isolated fixtures or demo sessions without credentials or private terminal output.
