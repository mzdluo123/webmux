# File Naming

A reader should be able to predict a file's name from what it owns. Names state the noun or responsibility, never a vague word. `internal/archtest` (`TestGoFileNames`) and `web/test/architecture.test.ts` (`file naming`) enforce the mechanical parts below; the rest is review judgement.

## Frontend (`web/`)

| Kind | Rule | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Svelte component | PascalCase, `<Family><Part>.svelte`; one family prefix per feature | `CodeFileTree.svelte`, `TerminalHeader.svelte` |
| Non-component TypeScript | kebab-case, `<domain>-<role>.ts` | `chat-api.ts`, `quick-commands.ts` |
| Rune state | `x.svelte.ts` holds `$state`; the pure logic lives in `x.ts` with the same stem | `quick-commands.ts` + `quick-commands.svelte.ts` |
| Unit test | `web/test/<source-stem>.test.ts` | `draft-storage.test.ts` |
| Browser test, story | `<Component>.test.ts` or `<Component>.stories.ts`; helpers stay kebab-case | `CodePanel.test.ts`, `terminal-fixture.ts` |
| shadcn-svelte base | generated under `src/lib/components/ui/`; keep the registry's names | `button/button.svelte` |

- Never mix camelCase into TypeScript file names, even for a single file. Identifiers inside the file stay camelCase.
- Group by prefix: all chat modules start with `chat-`, all code-reader modules with `code-`. Add a new member to the existing family instead of inventing a new prefix.
- Hooks that own a resource live in `src/hooks/`; page-level state lives in `src/pages/`. Otherwise a module sits next to its family.

## Go (`internal/`, `cmd/`)

| Kind | Rule | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source file | lowercase words joined by `_`, named for the noun or responsibility it owns | `ring.go`, `input_write.go`, `listening_ports.go` |
| Family | `<family>_<part>.go` so related files sort together | `cleanup_linux.go`, `chat_config_queue.go` |
| Platform | `_linux`, `_darwin`, `_windows` are build constraints; `_unix` and `_other` need a `//go:build` line | `proc_unix.go`, `proc_other.go` |
| Types | `types.go` only when a package has several small exported types shared by its files; a type with behavior goes in the file of its noun | `workspace/types.go` |
| Test | `<source-stem>_test.go` for that file's cases; a cross-file behavior may use a topic name | `ring_test.go`, `security_test.go` |

- Forbidden words anywhere in a name: `util`, `utils`, `helper`, `helpers`, `misc`, `more`, `common`, `stuff`, `extra`, `new`, `old`. Test fixtures are `*_fixtures_test.go`.
- When a file grows two responsibilities, split by responsibility and name each part. Do not add `_more` or `2` suffixes.
- Renames use `git mv` and stay separate from behavior changes. Update links in `docs/` and the persistence inventory (`internal/archtest/persistence_inventory.json` keys start with the file path) in the same change.

## Checklist

- [ ] The name predicts the contents without opening the file.
- [ ] A sibling already in the same family uses the same prefix.
- [ ] The test file's name points at the source file or states its topic.
- [ ] Docs and links that mention the old path were updated; `make docs-check` passes.
